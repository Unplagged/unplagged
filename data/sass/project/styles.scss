 * To edit the project styles, you need to:
 * 
 * 1. Install Compass: http://compass-style.org/ .
 * 2. Make changes to the appropriate .scss files in "/data/sass/project".
 * 3. Compile the stylesheet with Compass by calling "compass compile" on the 
 *    command line from within the root directory where the "config.rb" file is
 *    located.
 *
 * It's also possible to use "compass watch" to enable automatic compliation on 
 * saving of .scss files.
