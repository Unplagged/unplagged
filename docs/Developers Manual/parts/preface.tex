\chapter{Preface}

Even though the big media coverage and interest in plagiarism in Germany has very much subsided\citep{Google2012} 
after Minister Guttenberg had to resign, because of the plagiarisms found in his doctoral thesis, the initial idea
for the 
creation of the \enquote{Unplagged} project, whose development approach will be described here, can be found in this 
very case of plagiarism. Related to it were the formation of the
\href{http://de.guttenplag.wikia.com/wiki/GuttenPlag\_Wiki}{GuttenPlag} and it's descendent 
\href{http://de.vroniplag.wikia.com/wiki/Home}{VroniPlag}, both are Wiki-based communities that collaboratively 
discover and collect plagiarism in their respective cases and are kind of the role models for the way the
Unplagged system is build.

The initial project idea and context were provided by our professor Dr. Debora Weber-Wulff and the two term master project
every media informatics student at the HTW has to take. As professor Weber-Wulff is a well known expert in Germany on the
topic of plagiarism,
does research in this field for over ten years\citep{Spiegel-Online2011} and is actively involved in the VroniPlag
community, she came up with the idea to build a dedicated system --- a \enquote{Plagiarism Detection Cockpit}\citep{Weber-Wulff2011}, 
that is modeled after the experiences that were made
with the workflow used in VroniPlag and GuttenPlag.


So, to put it in a catchy marketing phrase, here is what Unplagged aims to become: 

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Unplagged is a simple, web-based, collaborative system to help discovering, collecting and 
documenting plagiarism in scientific papers.}
\end{quote}

To make things a bit more conceivable, we also often refer to it as a mixture of a very specialised text editor, with a focus on 
comparing texts and marking 
passages and a modern project management tool like \href{http://www.redmine.org/}{Redmine} or 
\href{http://www.atlassian.com/JIRA}{JIRA}, 
to manage the collaborative parts of the system. The big distinction to other plagiarism tools on the market is, that we are not 
trying to autodetect plagiarism, but focusing on aiding the workflow of the users while he/she is searching for plagiarized
fragments inside a specific paper.

\section{Chapter Overview}

One of the biggest problems we faced at the start was, that none of the team members had written more than a bachelors
thesis and therefore the experience we got with actual scientific writing was very limited and very specific to the 
field of computer science. We understand the ethical problems, that come with the betrayal of 
good scientific practice of plagiators, but we simply can not relate easily to the amount of work that has to be put into 
a Ph D., or be as 
passionate about plagiarism as Prof. Weber-Wulff always is.

That is why we had a lot of catching up to do on the most important history behind VroniPlag, the different types
of plagiarism, citation styles and the research Prof. Weber-Wulff and others had already done on systems that try to 
help finding plagiarism. This is what will be described in chapter \ref{chap:plagOverview}, \nameref{chap:plagOverview}, which
gives a brief overview of all the important topics there.

Although we are using agile methods for the development process, the chapter \nameref{chap:systemRequirements} will give
a more classical collection and description of the parts the system will consist of and how we understood the requirements of the 
VroniPlag workflow.

If you know all those things already and simply want to get started working and coding, you should probably jump
to \nameref{chap:developingUnplagged}, where the installation process and all necessary tools for you as a developer are
described.
