YZIZ AS THE SOUL/ THE SOUL AS FNQZIZ.
The second proposition of Thales declares that the
All is alive, or has Soul in it (To nav Z-fptpuxov). This
statement accounts for the mobility of cpU0'1§. Its motion.
and its power of generating things other than itself, are
due to its life (ipuxrﬁ), an inward, spontaneous principle
of activity. (Cf. Plato, Laws 892c: q>t':o1v [5o1'17\ov-rat 7\é-

It is a general rule that the Greek philosophers describe
qauoig as standing in the same relation to the universe as
soul does to body. Anaximenes, the third Milesian, says:
oiov f] tpuxﬁ ii ﬁpsrépa aﬁp ofiaa ouykpa-rsi ﬁpag, Kai
6?\ov Tov Kéopov Trvsﬁpa KC1l aﬁp TFEp1éXE1.“AS our soul
is air and holds us together, so a breath or air embraces the
whole cosmos.”‘...
The second function of Soul — knowing — was not at
ﬁrst distinguished from motion. Aristotle says, qpapév yap

conﬁdence and fear, and again to be angry, to perceive.
and to think; and all these states are held to be move-
ments, which might lead one to suppose that soul itself is
moved.“ Sense-perception (a’1'o6no1g), not distinguished
from thought, was taken as the type of all cognition, and
this is a form of action at a distance?
Frag. 2. Compare Pythagoras’ “boundless breath” outside the heavens, which is
inhaled by the world (Arist., Phys. 213b22 ), and Heraclitus' “divine reason," which
surrounds (rrspiéxsi) us and which we draw in by means of respiration (Sext. Emp.
Adv. Math. vii.127).

hold that like perceives and knows like, "assume that perceiving is a sort of being
acted upon or moved and that the same is true of thinking and knowing” (To I:
